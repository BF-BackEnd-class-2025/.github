# ☕ Java Backend Development – Class 2025 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the **Java Backend Development** GitHub repository! 🌟 Over the next 12 weeks, you’ll go from Java fundamentals
to building fully functional REST APIs using Spring Boot and databases. This hands-on, project-driven program is perfect for
aspiring backend developers who want to master the Java ecosystem.

## Introduction

This course is designed to equip you with the skills needed to develop robust, scalable backend systems. 🧑‍💻
You’ll start with Java basics, explore object-oriented programming, and progress toward building production-ready
applications with Spring Boot, databases, and authentication.

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, you will:

- Master Java syntax, OOP principles, and collections. ☕
- Handle files and exceptions effectively. 📂
- Work with relational databases via JDBC and JPA/Hibernate. 🗃️
